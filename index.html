                <p>I am a Software Engineer at Guidewire Software. Our mission is to deliver the industry platform that P&C insurers rely upon to adapt and succeed in a 
                    time of accelerating changeâ€”and to ensure that every customer succeeds in the journey.</p>
                <br><p>Previously I was a Product Manager at <b>Spell Train</b>. Spell Train changed the way educators learned and retained information by integrating machine learning algorithms,
                ease of use, and always availble. Spell Train simulated how real Spelling Competations are conducted by integrating Amazon Alexa in the application and allowing it to grow as you grow.
